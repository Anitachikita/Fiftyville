# Fiftyville Mystery Solver (Harvard CS50 Project)

Welcome to the Fiftyville Mystery Solver project! This project is a part of the Harvard CS50 Course, where you I was tasked with solving the mystery of the stolen CS50 Duck in the town of Fiftyville. My goal was to identify the thief, the city they escaped to, and their accomplice using SQL queries to process the town's data. All we know is that the theft took place on July 28, 2021, on Humphrey Street.

## Data and Tools

I worked with the "fiftyville.db" SQLite database, provided by Harvard CS50 Course . The database contains tables of data from around the town. Using SQL SELECT queries, you will access and analyze the data to solve the mystery.
